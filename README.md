## :v: Contributing

*NOTE: if you want to change the [project content](./content) or fix any typo you can do that from github's ui without cloning the repo locally*

After cloning & setting up the local project you can push the changes to your github fork and make a pull request.

## Explication for the tools

1. Express
  
 Express is a minimaland flexible framework for node .js web application that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
  It is simple to use and fulfil the requirements for a web api, it's also possible to find some more advanced features, but there are some cases thats Express is requested
  
2. Mongoose

  Mongoose is a Nodejs library that provides a schema-based solution for modeling your application data. It has a system of converting types, validating, creating queries, and hooks for business logic.
  Mongoose provides a mapping of MongoDB objects similar to Object Relational Mapping (ORM), or Object Data Mapping (ODM) in the case of Mongoose. This means that Mongoose translates the database data into JavaScript objects so that it can be used by your application.
  
3. JWT

  Json web token is a way to verify if a particular person has access to the REST API developed, is widely used in application development.
  
4. lodash

  Is a library for handling arrays, I like to use it because array operations become more concise and avoid additional code
  
5. Swagger

  Simplify API development for users, teams, and enterprises with the Swagger open source and professional toolset. Find out how Swagger can help you design and document your APIs at scale.
  I use it because it is an efficient way to assemble a documentation and can also do tests, check types of returns, among other features
  
6. Jest

  Jest is a test library that can be used in conjunction with other utilities such as supertest to perform http requests
  
7. Typescript

  TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, that is, a set of tools and more efficient ways to write JavaScript code, adding features that are not natively present in the language.
